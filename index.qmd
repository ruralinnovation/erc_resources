The data team at CORI created the [Economic Development Tool](https://erc-tool.ruralinnovation.us/){.external target="_blank"} to aid the Fellows in their work by providing analysis and data on a wide variety of economic indicators.

### Ad hoc data support
If you have any questions or would like additional help integrating any of this data into your workflow, please reach out to Drew (drew.rosebush@ruralinnovation.us) or Brittany (brittany.kainen@ruralinnovation.us) on the Rural Innovation data team.  
You are also welcome to attend our open office hours, which are held on the first and third Thursdays of every month.
